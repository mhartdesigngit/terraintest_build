Use the arrowkeys to navigate the viewcam.
After testing Level press Escape to end application. 

Insert numbers in the plantcount and rockcount-field to setup the number of assets to spawn randomly.


Future Plans: 

> adding a heightcalculation, so the assetsspawning makes more sense. Currently they spawn at
every height and slopeness. 

> recalculate the randomness of the spawnpoints. changing from int to float.

> changing Escape-Key action into back-to-menu action

> increasing numbers of textures to apply
